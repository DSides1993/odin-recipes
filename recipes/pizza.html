    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the pizza recipe from Basics with Babish.  It's good pizza.</p>
    <p>This will walk you through both the crust and the sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients: Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Bread flour</li>
        <li>16g kosher salt</li>
        <li>1g active dry yeast</li>
        <li>350 ml water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients: Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>28oz can of whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>Onion powder</li>
        <li>Dried Oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps: Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend the flour, active dry yeast, and salt. Add the water and, with a wooden spoon or your hands, mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow it to rise at room temperature for 18 hours or until it has more than doubled. It will take longer in a chilly room and less time in a very warm one.</li>
        <li>Flour a work surface and scrape out the dough. Divide it into 4 equal parts and shape them. For each portion, start with the right side of the dough and pull it towards the center; then do the same with the left, then the top, then the bottom (the order doesn’t actually matter; what you want is four folds). Shape each portion into a round and turn seam side down. Mold the dough into a neat circular mound. The mounds should not be sticky; if they are, dust with more flour.</li>
        <li>If you don’t intend to use the dough right away, wrap the balls individually in plastic and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Return to room temperature by leaving them out on the counter, covered in a damp cloth, for 2 to 3 hours before needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps: Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by heating olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Then add some roughly cut garlic and saute for one minute. Add some red pepper flakes and let those cook for about 10-15 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add a 28-ounce can of whole San Marzano tomatoes. Stir in and lightly break up the tomatoes. Add some dry onion powder along with some dry oregano, stir to combine and let simmer for 30-45 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add sauce to a blender and puree for about 10-15 seconds. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps: Building</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slowly start to pat the dough down into the general shape of a pizza. Don’t roll it out with a rolling pin. Once the dough had grown in size, pass over your knuckles and slowly start to spread it out until a pizza pie shape is formed. </li>
        <li>Add your sauce and low moisture mozzarella along with whatever toppings you’d like and place on your pizza stone in your preheated 500°F oven (pre-heat for 1 hour). Bake for 7-9 minutes. </li>
        <li>Let cool for a few minutes. Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
